Okay, let's see. I need to find a Python solution for this problem where the input is an integer a between 0 and 35, and the output is another integer. The examples given are when input is 3, output is 8, and input 10 gives 1024. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the examples. For input 3, output 8. 2^3 is 8. Oh right, that's straightforward. Then for 10, 2^10 is 1024. So the pattern here seems to be that the output is 2 raised to the power of a. So the problem is probably to compute 2^a. But wait,
