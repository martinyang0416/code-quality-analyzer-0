Okay, let's see. The problem is to take an input integer a between 1 and 30 and output another integer. The example given is input 3 outputs 27. Hmm, wait, 3 cubed is 27. So maybe the task is to compute a cubed? That seems straightforward. But let me think again. Are there any other possible interpretations? Like maybe factorial or something else? Let's check the example again. 3*3*3 is 27, which fits. So if a is 3, output is 3^3. Let's test another example in my mind. If a was 2, then output sh
