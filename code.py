Okay, let's see. The problem is to take an integer a between 0 and 35 and output some number. The examples given are when input is 3, output is 8, and input 10 gives 1024. Hmm. Wait, 3 gives 8... Oh right, 2^3 is 8. And 10 is 2^10 which is 1024. So the problem must be to compute 2 raised to the power of a. But wait, let me think again. The input is a, and output is 2^a?

Yes, that seems to fit the examples. Let me check another case. Like if a is 0, then 2^0 is 1, so output should be 1. If a is
