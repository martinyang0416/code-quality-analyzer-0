Okay, I need to solve this problem where the input is an integer a between 1 and 30, and the output is another integer. The example given is input 3 outputs 27. Let me think about what's going on here. 

Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. Oh wait, so maybe the problem is just to compute a cubed? Let me check. If that's the case, then the output is simply a multiplied by itself three times. So for a=3, 3*3*3 is 27, which matches the example. 

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think of other possibil
